## Introduction
 
This on-line webbook is a collection of iPython/JupyterLab articles (as in the article class in LaTex) useful for ENGR-1330 sections taught by the first two authors; It is organized in a topical sequence envisioned by the lead author -- instructors are not expected to use all the articles, but instead would select appropriate articles as readings to support their course.  A couple of suggested syllabi are included in the [Appendix](https://#).

## Document History
This document is a living document and is updated frequently, Python is an ever evolving tool and stuff that works today will be constructively broken by the development team (python.org) in their quest for continuous improvement.  Generally these changes occur in the packages (libraries, external modules) and base python is quite stable.  The scripts herein are intended for use with Python 3.X installations, and may not be backward compatable.
