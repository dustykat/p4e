    "**Reliability Example**\n",
    "Suppose we wish to estimate the reliability of a system comprised of many indetical parts iused in multiple places in a design, for instance rivets on an airplane wing. Using a Bernoulli model (which you will see in your statistics class) we can estimate the collective reliability of the system (all the parts work as desired).  The reliability is expressed as the fraction of time that no parts have failed, if the fraction is small we would want to either improve part reliability, or ensure redundancy so the system can function with broken parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $p$ be the probability a single component is good and $N$ be the total number of components in the system that work together in a \"series\" context.  The reliability, or the percentage of time that none of the components have failed is given by the Bernoulli equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\% = (\\frac{p}{100.0})^N \\cdot 100.0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want a script to read in a component probability and count, and estimate system reliability -- we can apply our problem solving protocol and JupyterLab to do so, and the task will be mostly sequential\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 Problem Statement** Estimate the reliability of a component in an instrument relative to a group of components using a Bernoulli approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 Input/Output Decomposition** Inputs are the reliability of a single component and the number of components working together in a system, output is estimate of system reliability, governing principle is the Bernoulli equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 By-Hand Example**\n",
    "SUppose the system is a small FPGA with 20 transistors, each with reliability of 96-percent. The entire array reliability is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{percentage} = (\\frac{96.0}{100.0})^{20} \\cdot 100.0 = 44.2\\%$$\n",
