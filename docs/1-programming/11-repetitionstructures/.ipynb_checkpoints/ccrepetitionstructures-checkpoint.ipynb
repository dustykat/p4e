    "# Repetition Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The action of doing something over and over again (repetition) is called a loop - the name becomes apparent when we examine a flowchart representation of repetition.  Loops repeat a portion of code a finite number of times until a process is complete. Repetitive tasks are very common and essential in programming. They save time in coding, minimize coding errors, and leverage the speed of electronic computation.\n",

    "## Loop Analogs\n",
    "If you think any mass manufacturing process, we apply the same process again and again. Even for something very simple such as preparing a peanut butter sandwich:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the ***flowchart*** in Figure 1, it represents a decomposition of sandwich assembly, but at a high level -- for instance, `Gather Ingredients` contains a lot of substeps that would need to be decomposed if fully automated assembly were to be accomplished; nevertheless lets stipulate that this flowchart will indeed construct a single sandwich.\n",

    "If we need to make 1000 peanut butter sandwichs we would then issue a directive to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Implement sandwich assembly, repeat 999 times (repeat is the loop structure) (A serial structure, 1 sandwich artist, doing same job over and over again)\n",
    "\n",
    "**OR**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Implement 1000 sandwich assembly threads (A parallel structure, 1000 sandwich artists doing same job once)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general because we dont want to idle 999 sandwich artists, we would choose the serial structure, which frees 999 people to ask the existential question \"would you like fries with that?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All cynicism aside, an automated process such as a loop, is typical in computational processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Aside*** NVIDIA CUDA, and AMD OpenGL compilers can detect the structure above, and if there are enough GPU threads available , create the 1000 sandwich artists (1000 GPU threads), and run the process in parallel -- the actual workload is unchanged in a thermodynamic sense, but the apparent time (in human terms) spent in sandwich creation is a fraction of the serial approach.  This parallelization is called unrolling the loop, and is a pretty common optimization step during compilation. This kind of programming is outside the scope of this class.\n",

    "Main attractiveness of loops is:\n",

    "# Count controlled repetition `for` loop structure)\n",
    "Count-controlled repetition is also called definite repetition because the number of repetitions is known before the loop begins executing. \n",
    "When we do not know in advance the number of times we want to execute a statement, we cannot use count-controlled repetition (`while` structure discussed later). \n",
    "In such an instance, we would use sentinel-controlled repetition. \n",

    "We can use both `for` and `while` loops, for count controlled repetition, but the `for` loop in combination with the `range()` function is more common.\n",

    "### Structured `FOR` loop\n",
    "We have seen the for loop already, but we will formally introduce it here. The `for` loop executes a block of code repeatedly until the condition in the `for` statement is no longer true.\n",
