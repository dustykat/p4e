    "## What is a data structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structures are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more effectively, and maintain the program easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our iPython world the most common structures are illustrated in the figure below; here we are interested primarily in lists and dictionaries; the array structure is a special type of list that is explored later on, and the set is a special type of dictionary. Tuples are immutable, so are also left for later.\n",

    "A definition from https://www.dictionary.com/browse/mutable is\n",

    "mutable [ myoo-tuh-buhl ]\n",

    "See synonyms for: mutable / mutability on [Thesaurus.com](Thesaurus.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "adjective\n",

    "1. liable or subject to change or alteration.\n",
    "2. given to changing; constantly changing; fickle or inconstant: the mutable ways of fortune.\n",
    "3. Computers. (in object-oriented programming) of or noting an object having properties whose values can change while the object itself maintains a unique identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last definition is the one we seek, a mutable structure can have changing contents but the structure itself maintains identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A named constant `7` which we cannot change, is immutable, but a variable like `seven` which can change is in contrast, mutable."

    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a collection of data that are somehow related. It is a convenient way to refer to a\n",
    "collection of similar things by a single name, and using an index (like a subscript in math)\n",
    "to identify a particular item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the \"math-like\" variable $x$ below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather}\n",
    "x_0= 7 \\\\\n",
    "x_1= 11 \\\\\n",
    "x_2= 5 \\\\\n",
    "x_3= 9 \\\\\n",
    "x_4= 13 \\\\\n",
    "x_5= 223 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{gather}\n",
    "    \n",
    "The variable name is $x$ and the subscripts correspond to different values. \n",
    "Thus the `value` of the variable named $x$ associated with subscript $3$ is the number $9$.  \n",
    "In our scripts the concept of subscript is replaced by a position or index, but it performs the same role - it identifies the particular container in the list, and lets us access the contents of the container. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below is a visual representation of a the concept that treats a variable as a collection of cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](list-schematic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure, the variable name is `MyList`, the subscripts are replaced by a position (index) indicator\n",
    "that identifies which cell is being referenced. \n",
    "The value is the cell content at the particular index. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in the figure the value of `MyList` at Position Index = 3 is the number 9.'\n",
    "\n",
    "In engineering and data science we use lists a lot - we often call then vectors, arrays, matrices and such, but they are ultimately just lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a list you can write the list name and assign it values. \n",
    "The square brackets are used to identify that the variable is a list. \n",
