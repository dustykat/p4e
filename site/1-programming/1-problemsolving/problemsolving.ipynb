    "## Computational Thinking and Problem Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational thinking (CT) refers to the thought processes involved in expressing solutions as computational steps or algorithms that can be carried out by a computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "CT is literally a process for breaking down a problem into smaller parts, looking for patterns in the problems, identifying what kind of information is needed, developing a step-by-step solution, and implementing that solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decomposition** is the process of taking a complex problem and breaking it into more manageable sub-problems. Decomposition often leaves a framework of sub-problems that later have to be assembled (system integration) to produce a desired solution.\n",
    "2. **Pattern Recognition** refers to finding similarities, or shared characteristics of problems, which allows a complex problem to become easier to solve, and allows use of same solution method for each occurrence of the pattern. \n",
    "3. **Abstraction** is the process of identifying important characteristics of the problem and ignore characteristics that are not important. We use these characteristics to create a representation of what we are trying to solve.\n",
    "4. **Algorithms** are step-by-step instructions of how to solve a problem \n",
    "5. **System Integration** (implementation)is the assembly of the parts above into the complete (integrated) solution.  Integration combines parts into a program which is the realization of an algorithm using a syntax that the computer can understand. \n"

    "## Programming as a problem solving process\n",
    "The entire point of this course is to develop problem solving skills and begin using some tools (Statistics, Numerical Methods, Data Science, implemented as JupyterLab/Python programs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scientific method [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) is one example of an effective problem solving strategy. Stated as a protocol it goes something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observation: Formulation of a question\n",
    "2. Hypothesis: A  conjecture that may explain observed behavior. Falsifiable by an experiment whose outcome conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis\n",
    "3. Prediction: How the experiment should conclude if hypothesis is correct \n",
    "4. Testing: Experimental design, and conduct of the experiment.\n",
    "5. Analysis: Interpretation of experimental results\n",
    " \n",
    "This protocol can be directly adapted to CT/DS problems as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the problem (problem statement)\n",
    "2. Gather information (identify known and unknown values, and governing equations)\n",
    "3. Generate and evaluate potential solutions\n",
    "4. Refine and implement a solution\n",
    "5. Verify and test the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For actual computational methods the protocol becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explicitly state the problem\n",
    "2. State:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Input information\n",
    "  - Governing equations or principles, and \n",
    "  - The required output information.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Work a sample problem by-hand for testing the general solution.\n",
    "4. Develop a general solution method (coding).\n",
    "5. Test the general solution against the by-hand example, then apply to the real problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oddly enough the first step is the most important and sometimes the most difficult. In a practical problem, step 2 is sometimes difficult because a skilled programmer is needed to translate the governing principles into an algorithm for the general solution (step 4)."
