    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `if` statement\n",
    "- `if....else` statements\n",
    "- `if....elif....else` statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are logical expressions that evaluate as TRUE or FALSE and using\n",
    "these results to perform further operations based on these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all flow control in a program depends on evaluating conditions. \n",
    "The program will proceed\n",
    "diferently based on the outcome of one or more conditions - really sophisticated AI programs are a collection of conditions and correlations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Expressed in a flowchart a block `if` statement looks like:\n",

    "It's a bit spooky, but ultimately just a program running in the background trying to make your money theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common conditional operation is comparison. If we wish to compare whether two\n",
    "variables are the same we use the `==` (double equal sign).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example `x == y` means the program will ask whether x and y have the same value. \n",
    "If they do, the result is TRUE if not then the result is FALSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other comparison signs are `!=` does NOT equal, `<` smaller than, `> `larger than, `<= `less than or equal, and `>=` greater than or equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also three logical operators when we want to build multiple compares\n",
    "(multiple conditioning); these are `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `and` operator returns TRUE if (and only if) **all** conditions are TRUE.\n",
    "For instance `5 == 5 and 5 < 6` will return a TRUE because both conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `or` operator returns `TRUE` if at least one condition is true. \n",
    "If **all** conditions are FALSE, then it will return a FALSE. For instance `4 > 3 or 17 > 20 or 3 == 2` will return `TRUE` because the first condition is true.\n",
    "The `not` operator returns `TRUE` if the condition after the `not` keyword is false. Think of it\n",
    "as a way to do a logic reversal.\n"

    "\n",
    "If light is directed into one end of a long glass or plastic rod the light is totally reflected by the walls bounging until it reaches the end of the rod.  Light pipes use this optical phenomenon to transmit light and even images from one place to another.  If one bends a light pipe the light can be coaxed to follow the pipe and curve around corners -- if the pipes are bundled into a collection of fibers mutiple signals can be sent down each fiber and these bundles are the main component of optical fiber communication and is schematized in the figure below.\n",
