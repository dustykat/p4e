    "# Function\n",
    "Functions are simply pre-written code fragments that perform a certain task. In older procedural languages functions and subroutines are similar, but a function returns a value whereas a subroutine operates on data. The difference is subtle but important. \n",
    "\n",
    "More recent thinking has functions being able to operate on data (they always could) and the value returned may be simply an exit code. An analogy are the functions in *MS Excel*. To add numbers, we can use the sum(range) function and type `=sum(A1:A5)` instead of typing `=A1+A2+A3+A4+A5`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling the Function\n",
    "We call a function simply by typing the name of the function or by using the dot notation.\n",
    "Whether we can use the dot notation or not depends on how the function is written, whether it is part of a class, and how it is imported into a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions expect us to pass data to them to perform their tasks. \n",
    "These data are known as parameters( older terminology is arguments, or argument list) and we pass them to the function by enclosing their values in parenthesis ( ) separated by commas. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the `print()` function for displaying text on the screen is \\called\" by typing `print('Hello World')` where print is the name of the function and the literal (a string) 'Hello World' is the argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program flow\n",
    "A function, whether built-in, or added must be defined *before* it is called, otherwise the script will fail.  Certain built-in functions \"self define\" upon start (such as `print()` and `type()` and we need not worry about those funtions).  The diagram below illustrates the requesite flow control for functions that need to be defined before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](flow-control-diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An example below  will illustrate, change the cell to code and run it, you should get an error.\n",
    "Then fix the indicated line (remove the leading \"#\" in the import math ... line) and rerun, should get a functioning script."
