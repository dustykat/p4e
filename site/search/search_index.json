Special Notes The structure is written to work on a web host, with hostname == atomickitty.ddns.net , if you clone to another server you will have the lovely task of changing the links. The string editor sed will become your friend! Materials herein come from many sources, in particular the Data8 repository from UC Berkeley. Sources in notebooks are at least cited by a URL. As the content is matured, proper citations are to be inserted. The 3-Readings directory contains copyrighted materials and should be exposed with care on a web server; generally no-one reads anymore, so its probably safe enought to protect using .htaccess simple uid:pwd approach. I use the materials during lectures to point out where I obtain various computational ideas. How to Use Clone the entire repository to /var/www/html/engr-1330-webbook. Have your main index point to this directory i.e. http://your-fqdn-server.org/engr-1330-webroot/ You can see working example at https://3.137.111.182/engr-1330-webbook/ (You will have to set a browser exception to accept the self-signed certificate) Syncronization Notes: Sync with 3.137.111.182/engr-1330-webbook/ (AWS server -- primary and live website copy) Sync with 75.3.84.227:192.168.1.75/ (Raspberry Pi -- developer and backup website copy) Sync with 75.3.84.227:192.168.1.79/ (Macintosh -- developer copy) About this document Put something here about the document, authors, copyright (GPL or MIT Open License) On-Line Book Author's Notes Inserting Code Fragments To insert a code fragment such as print('Hello World') simply indent in the source file used to generate the document print('hello world') These fragments can be cut-and-paste into a JupyterLab notebook. Inserting Images If the image is taken from a URL, use the following: ![image-name (a local tag)](url_to_image_source) Such as: ![image-name](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQqn40YbupkMAzY63jYtA6auEmjRfCOvCd0FA&usqp=CAU) Which will render a black swan: If the image is local to the host replace the url with the path to the image. Inserting URL links This is a variation of images, but without the ! , such as [link-name-that-will-display](url_to_link_destimation) For example the code below will link to the black swan search results: [link-to-images-of-black-swans](https://www.google.com/search?q=images+of+black+swan&client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk03oIoQ387TWjJoKzX-D_b7o1to43Q:1613002985584&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=L2P5MiS1ICLTxM%252CC6BDdJoXT9KcEM%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kTXrBMpj__xL5IkGCshrXTp04fX3w&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiCneivyODuAhVJBs0KHY88CaAQ9QF6BAgUEAE&biw=1447&bih=975#imgrc=i_lxoojURNE3XM) link-to-images-of-black-swans","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-engr-1330-webbook","text":"The purpose of the webook/repository is to maintain a convienent back-up of course content for rapid migration across servers.","title":"About ENGR 1330 Webbook"},{"location":"about/#special-notes","text":"The structure is written to work on a web host, with hostname == atomickitty.ddns.net , if you clone to another server you will have the lovely task of changing the links.
