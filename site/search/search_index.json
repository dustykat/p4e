A couple of suggested syllabi are included in the Appendix . suggested citation: Theodore G.

Generally these changes occur in the packages (libraries, external modules) and base python is quite stable. The scripts herein are intended for use with Python 3.X installations, and may not be backward compatable. The major change we have observed is the syntax of output and various module name changes.","title":"<p style=\"text-align:center\">Python (and Data Science) for Engineers</p>"},{"location":"#python-and-data-science-for-engineers","text":"","title":"Python (and Data Science) for Engineers"},{"location":"#a-webbook-to-accompany-computational-thinking-and-data-science-engr-1330-at-texas-tech-university","text":"by Theodore G.
