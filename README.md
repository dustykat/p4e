# Python for Engineers
A webbook to accompany ENGR-1330 at Texas Tech University.

## General Contents

## Structure
This repository is intended to be loaded into a webroot directory, I use a symbolic link such as `https://fqdn/p4e/site` -> `/var/www/html/p4e/site`. The `site` is built using mkdocs.  Internal links are used to let users download the source pages (all are developed in jupyterlab). and support files.
